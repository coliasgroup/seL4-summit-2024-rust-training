# In Your Project

**Exercise (challenge):**
If you have a Microkit project that you are hacking on, start a new branch and either begin replacing one of your protection domains with one written in Rust, or add a new one written in Rust.

The instructor can help you navigate the introduction of Rust into to your build system, and can help you apply what you've learned to your own project.
